# ESP32 USB Development Tool

This board adapts USB (either a type-C socket or a cable) to a Tag Connect
TC2030-compatible footprint, for use with the on-chip USB JTAG and UART
functionality.  The Tag Connect footprint is compatible with the TC2030-USB, but
the two N/C pins in that footprint are used for reset and bootloader buttons.
